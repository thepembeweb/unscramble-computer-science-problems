Analysis

Task 0:
 - Time Complexity - O(1)
 - This algorithm is constant time because has a running time independent of the input size

Task 1:
 - Time Complexity - O(n)
 - This algorithm is linear time because even though it has two separate for-loops that 
   are dependant on the input, each one iterating from 1 to n, these result in O(2n) which 
   in turn, following the Big-O coefficient rule of dropping constants(coefficients in Big-O 
   are negligible with large input sizes), result in the time complexity being simplified to O(n)

Task 2:
 - Time Complexity - O(n)
 - This algorithm is linear time because it has one for-loop that iterates from 1 to n which 
   results in a running time grows directly in proportion to n.

Task 3:
 - Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
 - This algorithm is superlinear time because even though it has two separate for-loops that 
   are dependant on the input, each one iterating from 1 to n, resulting in O(2n); it also has 
   a sorting function which is 0(nlogn). Combining these two results in 0(2n + nlogn). 
   However following the Big-O rule of dropping non-dominant terms (less dominant terms in Big-O are 
   negligible with large input sizes), the time complexity can be simplified to O(nlog(n))
   
Task 4:
 - Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
 - This algorithm is superlinear time because even though it has two separate for-loops that 
   are dependant on the input, each one iterating from 1 to n, resulting in O(2n); it also has 
   a sorting function which is 0(nlogn). Combining these two results in 0(2n + nlogn). 
   However following the Big-O rule of dropping non-dominant terms (less dominant terms in Big-O are 
   negligible with large input sizes), the time complexity can be simplified to O(nlog(n))
